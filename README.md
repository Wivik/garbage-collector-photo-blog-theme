[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Wivik_garbage-collector-photo-blog-theme&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Wivik_garbage-collector-photo-blog-theme)

## Introduction

This theme is a custom-made for [my Photo Blog](https://photos.zedas.fr) based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It is a complete new version of my previous [theme](https://github.com/Wivik/garbage-collector-photo-blog) which remains available. The front page displays the album covers, and the post page displays the gallery content with no distraction, priority to the photos. The album can be adapted to put a focus on a perticular image, add a section break, a description, etc. Each photo is viewable on a display page that will also render the EXIF metadata suchs as the pictures settings and the license.

The biggest difference with my previous theme is the pictures management : instead of having one page that links all pictures, a markdown file is created for each of them. Each page is customizable using Hugo's YAML metadata block. Please refer to the explanations below.

## How to install

Clone this repository and add the theme to your Hugo configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wivik/garbage-collector-photo-blog-theme
```

In your config file :

```yaml
theme: garbage-collector-photo-blog-theme
```

## Configuration

This theme is very simple to configure.

Last element : the album generation script.

At the root directory of this theme, a Python script named `new.py` was made to generate a new album. You may create a symbolink link to your Hugo site root folder to use it.

Example with symlink :

```bash
cd <your hugo site root folder>
ln -s themes/garbage-collector-photo-blog-theme/new.py new.py
```

This script will create the new album main page (`_index.md`) and a page for each photo, took in the file name order (ex: `photo1.md`, `photo2.md`...). See explanations just after in the [How to use](#how-to-use) section.

## How to use

### Quickstart

Create a directory your Hugo site `assets/` folder, for example `my-photos-album`, and put your pictures inside it.

Use the script `new.py` to create the new album :

```bash
cd <your hugo website root folder>
python new.py my-photos-album
```

The name of the folder must match the folder name inside `assets/`.

The following structure in `contents/` will be created :

```bash
my-photos-album
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2633.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2634.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2635.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2636.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2638.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2639.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2641.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dsc_2642.md
â””â”€â”€ _index.md

```

Open `my-photos-album/_index.md` and edit the `photo` key to set the album thumbnail which is set to `default.png`. Replace it with a photo from the album :

```yaml
---
title: "Test"
date: 2023-07-21T18:33:15+02:00
# photo: "default.png" <<< default thumbnail
photo: "my-photos-album/photo1.jpg"
draft: false
## Optional additional meta info for resources list
#  description: A sub-title or description for the photo
tags:
  - Album
---

```

ðŸ’¡ The `default.png` file is not provided by this template, you can customize it by putting whichever file you want with this name in your `assets/` folder.

If you open a photo, the content will be similar :

```yaml
---
photo: "my-photos-album/photo2.jpg"
weight: "2"
draft: false
## Optional additional meta info for resources list
#  alt: Image alternative and screen-reader text
#  title: A title for the photo
#  description: A sub-title or description for the photo
---
```


Open your Hugo website, your photo album is here ! Now you can customize it.

### Customize your album

This theme uses the YAML metadata to configure your album behavior. By default, the photos will be displayed in rows of two photos. One if mobile screen. Click on a photo will open it in a larger view that will display by default the EXIF metadata and a link to download it in the original format. The photo download is the default behavior, you can disable it in [Theme configuration](#theme-specific-configurations).

The album can be customized with the following options.

#### Customize the album header (_index.md)

The album header supports the following options :

| Options | Type | Mandatory | Description |
| ------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `description` | `string` | Yes | The album description. It will be displayed before the first photo.<br />The usage of the multiline YAML syntax is supported (`description: \|`).<br />Markdown content is supported in the description. |
| `tags` | `list` | Yes | A list of tags. `Album` will be always be set and should stay, it's required to see all albums |
| `title` | `string` | Yes | The album title displayed in the front page and the album page |

Please refer to the comments in [archetypes/default.md](archetypes/default.md) for an up-to-date and exhaustive supported options.

The photo listing is customizable by editing each photo file to match how you want to display them.

It will be displayed before the first photo.<br />The usage of the multiline YAML syntax is supported (`description: \|`).<br />Markdown content is supported in the description.<br />If `linebreak: true` is defined, the description will be shown below the photo in the album. |

### new.py reference

`new.py` is a helper script that will create your album. It currently supports the following options :


```bash

```

The tags will be appended to the default "Album" tag in the `_index.md` file.
